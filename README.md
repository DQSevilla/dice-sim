# dice-sim

Simulating n-sided die with coin flips

## Overall Goals:
- Given n, an arbitrary number of sides of a die, we want a program that:
  - Simulates one or more rolls of the die by repeatedly flipping one coin
  - Returns the minimum expected number of coin flips required to simulate a single roll of the die

This is an exercise and experiment in finding a lower and upper bound on the expected value of the number of coin flips it takes to sufficiently simulate a roll of a die.
